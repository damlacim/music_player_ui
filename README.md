# Music Player UI

Hey folks! I tried a new challenge. I have designed a music player screen but the music is not playing. Because sometimes not everyone can do their part.
Please don't blame them... 
Anyway, I think the build was a bit confusing. Frankly, I went a little crazy while writing the code. But it wasn't too bad. I am still learning...
I used our distinguished artist Safiye Soyman as an example. And of course her immortal work, Şımart Beni Aşkım.


The design looks like this ->

I wish the music played but the package exploded. That's why it doesn't play. 

So what did our big sis Safiye say?

>Bir şeyler yаpıp dа şımаrt beni. 🎶🎶
